# Auto-search-python-error-stackoverflow-
Tool that will execute a Python program and check for errors during execution and If there are errors, the tool will search for Stack Overflow threads that relate to the errors and open them as tabs in a web browser

Auto-search-python-error-stackoverflow.py is the main script which execute sample.py for errors

Stack Overflow is a source of helpful information for software development related queries. A few years post its inauguration, Stack Overflow became one of the norms of software development and is now a fundamental component of software development culture.

While coding, all of us get entangled in one or the other type of error very often. Thatâ€™s where the aid of sites like Stack Overflow comes into picture. The general pattern of our everyday software development life involves coding and testing the code. In case we encounter errors, we search for those errors on Google, Stack Overflow, etc., fix them and continue this cycle till we get our code running the way we need.

In this project, I create a tool (Python script) that will check our Python program for errors by executing it and on encountering any errors, it will search for it on Stack Overflow and open up a few threads in web browser tabs.
